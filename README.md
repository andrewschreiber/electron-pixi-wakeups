### Base app window with only a single graphic rectangle running at 1 fps and low-power power preference

Interestingly the renderer processes is much less active here despite being 1/60 the FPS


### Electron usage without Pixi application started

## Behavior Observations

- Doesn't matter if the window is displayed or not
- 'low-power' `powerPreference` doesn't seem to make a difference on energy impact or CPU use, but setting `maxFPS` does (despite a static graphic)
